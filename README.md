AI-Driven Dynamic Resource Allocation and node failure predictions in Cloud Environments

This repository contains reproducible implementations of three research papers focused on intelligent cloud resource management and optimization using machine learning methods. The projects include detailed simulations, algorithm implementations, and interactive web interfaces where applicable.

## Implementations

1. **Node Failure Analysis and Resilience**  
   *Paper:* [NodeFailures: Understanding and Mitigating Node Failures in Distributed Systems](https://hongyujohn.github.io/NodeFailures.pdf)  
   **Description:**  
   This implementation focuses on analyzing node failures in distributed systems. It includes models to simulate failure patterns, analyze system resilience, and propose recovery strategies using advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques.

2. **AI-Powered Dynamic Optimization of Cloud Resource Allocation**  
   *Paper:* [AI-Powered Dynamic Optimization of Cloud Resource Allocation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387724349_AI-Powered_Dynamic_Optimization_of_Cloud_Resource_Allocation)  
   **Description:**  
   This project implements a dynamic resource allocation system that leverages artificial intelligence to optimize cloud resource utilization in real time. The solution employs prediction models (e.g., LSTM networks) and reinforcement learning (e.g., DQN or PPO) to adjust resource distribution based on workload fluctuations while minimizing costs and enhancing performance.

3. **Intelligent Resource Allocation via Deep Learning**  
   *Paper:* [Intelligent Resource Allocation Optimization for Cloud Computing via Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03682)  
   **Description:**  
   In this work, advanced deep learning techniques are applied to forecast resource demand and optimize cloud resource allocation. The implementation integrates deep neural networks for demand prediction and reinforcement learning for scheduling, achieving significant improvements in efficiency and cost reduction.
